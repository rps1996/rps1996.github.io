		<h3>A Little Drawing</h3>
		<p>I've always been intimidated by drawing. When I was younger I went to an alternative school for a couple years that emphasized free hand drawing. I wondered at my other classmates' extensive artistic abilities while I struggled to even draw a balanced circle without a compass.</p>
		<p>Since then I have taken a couple drawing classes - kinda aimlessly - without any true purpose or outside motivation. I always had difficulty getting over my difficulties with proportions and shapes.</p>
		<p>When I recently decided that I wanted to learn more visual tools to pursue design, I realized that learning . Even as I focus heavily on digital skills: HTML/CSS, Photoshop InDesign etc...</p>
		<p>One of my first challenges - alongside a class I am taking with Parsons - was translating two images into graphic design. The first image I had to translate was that of a pine tree.</p>
