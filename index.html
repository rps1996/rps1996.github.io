      <p>A former ballet dancer, I currently live in New York city. You can usually find me on my yoga mat at your local yoga studio or at the <em>Hungarian Pastry Shop</em> reading a good book as I pick apart a delicious croissant. I really enjoy walking - everything from urban trekking to wilderness backpacking, playing guitar and generally having a good time with my friends.</p>

      <p>As an undergrad at Columbia University I am studying Architecture and East Asian Languages and Cultures. I am pursuing architecture as a means to both ground myself in conceptual thinking and explore my interest in urban design. I am really interested in the history and culture of China, and am working towards fluency in Mandarin. Some of my other courses have also focused on sustainability, another area of interest.</p>
